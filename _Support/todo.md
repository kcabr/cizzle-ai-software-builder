- Local Storage save all text onblur events - Reload as the first thing when opening app in case refresh you don't lose your place - Place refresh data button front and center - make sure Confirm "Are you sure" x2 with confirm('Are you absolutely sure?')
- Say don't put BEGIN CODE BLAH BLAH in the codebase
- Tell powershell to escape everything and be absolutely sure
- Change Planner to create at most 15 steps; larger chunks possibly containing multiple tasks instead of a singular task
- Remove double Existng code & token count header
- Remove PromptInstructions bar on CodeGen page
- Popup modal => reads planner response text and displays check boxes in grid with just the first header line as identifying text (not all the tasks and steps) - This will edit the plannerresponse text in state; This avoids having to go back and forth to the old page and scroll and put a manual X
